# Scalex — Roadmap

## Pending

- [ ] Publish plugin to Claude Code marketplace

### Community feedback: fuzzy not-found suggestions (#156)

- [x] `search` reverse-suffix matching — queries like `ScalaJSClassEmitter` suggest `ClassEmitter`
- [x] `explain` suffix auto-resolve — auto-shows best match when query is a superset
- [x] Unified not-found suggestions — `search`, `coverage` now show "Did you mean?" hints
- [x] Extracted `resolvePackage()`/`mkPackageNotFound()` — deduplicated package resolution from `package`/`api`/`summary`

### Community feedback: disambiguation & filtering (#132–#135)

**Bugs:**
- [x] `explain` import refs now filtered by `--path`/`--exclude-path` — were unfiltered before
- [x] `isTestFile` detects root-level `tests/`, `test/`, `testing/` — `startsWith` added alongside `contains`

**Disambiguation & ambiguity (reported in #132, #133, #134):**
- [x] `explain` disambiguation hints — "(N other matches — use package-qualified name or --path to disambiguate)"
- [x] `explain` package fallback — falls back to `summary` when symbol matches a package
- [x] `explain --shallow` — skip implementations and import refs
- [x] `explain --no-doc` — suppress Scaladoc section (#157)

**Overview quality (#132, #133, #135):**
- [x] Hub type casing — PascalCase preserved via `symbolsByName` lookup
- [x] Hub type noise filter — single-char names excluded; sorted by distinct-package count
- [x] Hub type signatures — one-line signature shown inline
- [x] `overview --path` — scopes all overview data to path prefix

**Filtering (#133, #135):**
- [x] `--exclude-path` — negative path filter on all commands via `filterSymbols`/`filterRefs`
- [x] `symbols --summary` — grouped counts by kind

**Output control (#134):**
- [x] Members deduplication — companion members deduplicated against primary in `explain`
- [x] `explain` totalImpls hint — "(showing N of M — use --impl-limit to adjust)"
- [ ] Batch output size estimation — warn or auto-limit when a single query in a batch would produce >100KB output

### Community feedback: exploration & impact analysis (#137)

- [x] `explain --inherited` — merge parent members into explain output, marking provenance; `members --inherited` already exists, expose it in the composite view
- [x] `refs --top N` — rank files by reference count (descending) instead of flat list; heaviest users surface first for impact analysis
- [ ] Directory-level dependency graph — `scalex dir-deps --path src/modules/auth/` aggregates imports by target directory with file counts; more granular than `overview --architecture` package-level graph (deferred — package→directory mapping adds complexity)

### Community feedback: UX & discovery (#141)

- [x] `explain` package fallback warning — stderr message when silently falling back to package summary
- [x] `entrypoints` command — find `@main`, `def main(`, `extends App`, test suites; small effort, useful for onboarding
- [x] Override markers in `members --inherited` — show `[override]` vs `[inherited from Parent]` markers

### Code quality improvements (#148)

- [x] Option bloom filters — `identifierBloom: Option[BloomFilter]` replaces null sentinel; index v8
- [x] Error handling — narrow `Exception` catches to `IOException` for file I/O; stderr logging for parse failures and unreadable files
- [x] Deduplicate extraction — shared `extractRawSymbols` used by both `extractSymbols` and `extractSymbolsFromSource`; fixes missing Given/Extension/Pkg.Object in diff command

### Discarded from #141

- ~~Approximate call graph (`calls` command)~~ — same reasoning as rejected "Static call graph (#101, #102)"; name-matched call targets produce false positives for common methods (`apply`, `map`, `get`)
- ~~Pipeline/flow command~~ — same reasoning as rejected in #121, #135; BFS without type resolution is fragile
- ~~Co-occurrence analysis~~ — pure text co-occurrence is what grep does; unclear value over `refs --categorize`

### Discarded from #137

- ~~Companion member dedup in `explain`~~ — already shipped in #136
- ~~Call-site extraction~~ — without type resolution, method name matching has high false positives for common names (`get`, `apply`, `map`); grep already does `\.method\(` matching; same reasoning as rejected "Static call graph (#101, #102)" and "Call-site vs override distinction (#103)"

### Discarded from #132–#135

- ~~Java member extraction (#135) [regex-based]~~ — regex-based approach was fragile; replaced with JavaParser AST-based extraction in #167
- ~~Re-exported type ranking (#132)~~ — detecting alias chains requires type resolution (unavailable without build server); name-based heuristics would produce false positives
- ~~Module/subproject awareness (#135)~~ — already discarded in #103; build file detection couples to external conventions
- ~~`flow`/`pipeline` command (#135)~~ — already discarded; BFS without type resolution is fragile via name collisions
- ~~`explain --expand-members` (#133, #134)~~ — `explain --expand N` + `body member --in Type` already covers this workflow; adding selective member expansion has diminishing returns vs composing existing commands
- ~~Cross-project most-imported ranking (#132)~~ — `search` already ranks by import count (shipped in #119)

### Discarded from #121

- ~~`scalex flow <from> <to>`~~ — BFS without type resolution is fragile via name collisions; fails "better than grep" gate (same reasoning as rejected `scalex path` in #102)
- ~~`scalex sealed <trait>`~~ — `hierarchy --down --depth 1` already serves this use case; marginal
- ~~Smarter default limits~~ — auto-summarize is hard to get right universally; better to give users explicit flags (`--members-limit`, `--definitions-only`)

## Completed

### JavaParser-based Java extraction (#167)

- [x] Replace regex-based Java symbol extraction with JavaParser AST parsing
- [x] Java symbol extraction (classes, interfaces, enums, records, methods, fields)
- [x] Java member extraction (constructors, nested types, enum constants, @Override detection)
- [x] Java body extraction with owner filtering
- [x] Centralized `isJavaFile()` routing — eliminates scattered `.endsWith(".java")` checks

### Extraction fixes (#127)

- Stop indexing local vals/defs inside method bodies — traversal skips `Defn.Def`/`Val`/`Var`/`Given`/`GivenAlias` bodies
- Case class constructor params in `extractMembers` — case class params are public vals; regular class params only if marked `val`/`var`

### Signal vs noise (#121)

- `package --definitions-only` — filter out vals/defs, show only class/trait/object/enum
- `overview` hub types filter stdlib — skip scala/java base types (object, serializable, anyval) to surface real domain hub types
- `explain` members sorted by kind — classes before defs before vals; `--members-limit N` flag (default 10)
- `explain` fuzzy fallback — if exact match fails, auto-show best fuzzy match with stderr hint
- `hierarchy` truncation count — "... and 87 more children" at depth limit instead of silent cut-off
- `scalex summary <package>` — sub-package view with symbol counts; middle ground between `overview` and `package`

### Reduce round-trips (#119, #120)

- `overview` defaults to `--no-tests`; `--include-tests` to opt in
- `Owner.member` dotted syntax for `explain` and `def` — `def MyService.findUser` resolves directly
- `explain --verbose` — show member signatures inline instead of just names
- `explain` inlines "Imported by" file list when count ≤ 10, shows count + hint otherwise
- `refs --count` summary mode — "12 importers, 4 extensions, 30 usages" without full file lists
- Companion-aware `members` — auto-shows companion object/class members
- `api --used-by <package>` — coupling analysis: which types from pkg A are used by pkg B
- `search` ranks by import count — heavily-imported types surface first
- `search --returns <Type>` / `--takes <Type>` — signature substring filter

### Phase 1–5: Foundation

- Git file listing, Scalameta parsing, in-memory index, find definition, find references, CLI
- `.scalex/index.bin` binary persistence with string interning, OID-based skip, auto-reindex
- Search ranking (exact → prefix → substring), `--kind` filter, `--limit N`, quiet indexing
- Claude Code plugin: `plugin.json`, `SKILL.md`, launcher script, install instructions
- GraalVM native image (28MB standalone binary), `build-native.sh`
- Binary format v3, bloom filters (Guava) for refs pre-screening, 20s timeout

### Phase 6: CI + Distribution

- GitHub Actions: native images on tag push (macOS arm64/x64, Linux x64)
- GitHub Releases, `install.sh` in plugin

### Phase 7: AI-Agent Innovations

- `batch`, `def --verbose`, `impl`, `refs --categorize`, `imports`
- Fallback hints, Scala 2 dialect fallback

### Phase 8: Testing

- 243 MUnit tests (ExtractionSuite: 50, IndexSuite: 68, AnalysisSuite: 23, CliSuite: 102)
- Coverage: symbol extraction, persistence roundtrip, OID caching, bloom filters, search ranking, refs categorization, word boundary matching

#### Benchmarks (native image)

| Project | Files | Symbols | Cold Index | Warm Index |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Production monorepo | 13,979 | 214,301 | 4.6s | 540ms |
| Scala 3 compiler | 17,733 | 203,077 | 2.9s | 412ms |

### Post-v1 features

#### Import confidence & alias tracking
- Confidence annotation (High/Medium/Low) based on imports; wildcard import resolution
- Alias tracking (`import X as Y`, `import {X => Y}`); `[via alias Y]` annotation in output

#### Performance improvements
- Eliminate double file read, skip save when nothing changed
- Lazy bloom filter deserialization (~45% off load time)
- Pre-compute search deduplication, adaptive bloom capacity
- Single-pass post-index map building (2 passes vs 7)

#### Parse error diagnostics
- Track/list files with parse errors via `scalex index --verbose`

#### Fuzzy camelCase search
- "hms" matches `HttpMessageService`; ranked below exact/prefix/substring

#### zsh compat + UX (#22)
- Bash re-exec guard, `-w`/`--workspace` flag, path-as-symbol hint

#### AI-agent ergonomics (#29)
- `--kind` filter on `def`, `--no-tests` global flag, `--path` filter
- `refs -C N` context lines, smarter `def` ranking

#### JSON output (#32)
- `--json` flag on all commands

#### Annotation search (#32)
- `scalex annotated <annotation>` with filters; annotations stored in binary index (v5)

#### Body search (#32)
- `scalex grep <pattern>` — regex search with `--path`, `--no-tests`, `-C N`, 20s timeout, `--count`
- Multi-pattern `-e` flag, POSIX regex auto-correction (`\|` → `|`)

#### AI agent UX (#43, #46)
- `--prefix`/`--exact` for search, `-c` alias for `--categorize`, condensed batch not-found
- `--categorize` default on refs, `--flat` opt-in

#### Codebase exploration (#48)
- `members`, `doc`, `search --definitions-only`, `refs --category`, `overview`

#### Codebase comprehension (#53, #54)
- `body`, `explain`, `hierarchy` (parents up + children down), `overrides`
- `members --inherited`, `overview --architecture`, `deps`, `context`
- `ast-pattern`, `diff`

#### Test awareness (#56)
- `tests` (MUnit, ScalaTest, specs2), `body` for test cases, `coverage`

#### Overview hub type filtering (#64)
- Exclude stdlib/framework types from hub rankings; surface project-own types

#### Symbol disambiguation (#80)
- `explain` uses `def` ranking, `hierarchy` cycle-detection fix

#### Profiling & benchmarking
- `--timings` flag, async-profiler scripts, JFR config, microbenchmark harness, `bench.sh`/`bench-compare.sh`

#### Warm-load optimization
- Lazy map building — 1.3–2.2x faster on scala3 (17.7k files)

#### Exploration & UX (#93–#96)
- Fuzzy "did you mean?" on not-found, `package` command
- `overview --no-tests`, `overview --focus-package`

#### API surface (#102, #103)
- `scalex api <package>` — show which symbols are imported by other packages (public API surface); cross-reference import data with `packageToSymbols`; zero index change, pure in-memory query

#### Community feedback (#101–#103)
- Package-qualified symbol lookup, type param indexing in extends clauses
- Companion merging in `explain`, `explain --expand N`
- Smarter refs/search ranking, lightweight Java file awareness
- `deps --depth N`, `members --verbose` default, `refs --strict`
- `scalex file <query>` — fuzzy camelCase-aware file search

## Discarded & Dead Ends

Items tried or evaluated and rejected — documented here to avoid re-exploring.

### Warm-load optimization attempts

Bottleneck: every query pays ~290ms `cache-load` + ~230ms `build-symbolsByName`. Cheapest commands ~361ms, most expensive ~666ms. Root cause is 269K `readUTF` string constructions — I/O and file size are not the bottleneck.

**Round 1 — discarded after benchmarking:**
- ~~Separate bloom storage~~ — only ~38ms difference; `skipBytes` already efficient
- ~~Varint encoding~~ — smaller file doesn't help CPU-bound string construction
- ~~Parallel index-build~~ — ~130ms savings on a phase lazy maps already skip
- ~~Memory-mapped I/O~~ — bottleneck is string construction; 23MB is OS page-cached

**Round 2 — attempted v7 format, reverted (all results within σ):**
- ~~Blooms at end~~ — skip 12MB saves ~67ms, but lowerName strings grew index 22→24MB, net zero
- ~~2-byte string indices~~ — actual table has 269K entries (need 4 bytes), dead code on real codebases
- ~~Pre-interned lowercase names~~ — +80K strings, +2MB; `groupBy` hash map building is the cost, not `toLowerCase`

Hyperfine v6 vs v7 (7 runs, warmup 2): `file` 361→371ms, `def` 591→580ms, `impl` 387→395ms, `refs` 666→646ms. All within σ.

**Round 2 — remaining ideas, also discarded:**
- ~~Lazy symbol deserialization~~ — custom lazy format, high complexity for a subset of commands
- ~~Pre-grouped symbol storage~~ — similar to pre-interned names which already failed in v7

### Rejected features

- ~~Reverse alias lookup~~ — agent can do 2-step lookup; risks worse-than-grep perf
- ~~Multi-workspace / cross-project awareness (#64)~~ — unnecessary; use `-w` flag on target workspace
- ~~`scalex pattern <name>` (#53)~~ — marginal for AI agents who infer patterns from `explain`
- ~~Static call graph (#101, #102)~~ — name-matched call targets produce false positives (`apply`, `map`, `get`); fails "better than grep" gate; AST traversal risks blowing perf budget
- ~~`scalex path <A> <B>` (#102)~~ — BFS without type resolution is fragile via name collisions; niche use case vs `deps`/`refs`
- ~~Module/subproject awareness (#103)~~ — detecting build files couples to external conventions that change; directory heuristics unreliable across project layouts
- ~~Call-site vs override distinction in refs (#103)~~ — `refs --categorize` already provides ExtendedBy/UsedAsType/Usage categories; marginal improvement for significant complexity
- ~~Structural pattern detection (#103)~~ — marginal for AI agents who infer patterns from `explain` output
- ~~`scalex imports <file>`~~ — `deps` already shows symbol-level dependencies; agent can read file top for imports
