# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Confidence annotations for `refs` output (High/Medium/Low) based on import resolution
  - **High**: reference is in the same package or has an explicit import
  - **Medium**: reference has a wildcard import (`import pkg._`) matching the target's package
  - **Low**: no matching import found
- `refs --categorize` groups by confidence level, then by category
- `refs` (non-categorized) sorts by confidence with section headers
- Wildcard import resolution in `imports` command — `import com.example._` now surfaces when searching for symbols in `com.example`
