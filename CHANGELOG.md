# Changelog

## [1.2.0] — 2026-03-15

### Performance
- Lazy bloom filter deserialization — non-bloom commands (`def`, `search`, `impl`, `symbols`, `packages`) skip deserializing blooms, cutting ~45% off index load time
- Skip index save when nothing changed — warm index no longer writes 22MB to disk when all files hit OID cache
- Eliminate double file read — `extractSymbols` reads each file once instead of twice (bloom filter + symbol extraction)
- Single-pass post-index map building — symbol/file maps built in 2 passes instead of 7 separate passes over 200K+ symbols
- Pre-computed search deduplication — `distinctBy` computed once at index time instead of every `search` call
- Adaptive bloom filter capacity — `max(500, source.length / 15)` scales bloom size with file size, reducing false positives for large files

## [1.1.0] — 2026-03-14

### Added
- Confidence annotations for `refs` output (High/Medium/Low) based on import resolution
  - **High**: reference is in the same package or has an explicit import
  - **Medium**: reference has a wildcard import (`import pkg._`) matching the target's package
  - **Low**: no matching import found
- `refs --categorize` groups by confidence level, then by category
- `refs` (non-categorized) sorts by confidence with section headers
- Wildcard import resolution in `imports` command — `import com.example._` now surfaces when searching for symbols in `com.example`
- Import alias tracking — `import X as Y` (Scala 3) and `import {X => Y}` (Scala 2) are now detected and followed
  - `refs X` also finds usages of alias `Y` in files that rename the import
  - Alias imports are classified as High confidence
  - Aliases survive binary cache roundtrip (index format bumped to v4)
- Alias-aware confidence: `resolveConfidence` now checks alias mappings — searching by alias name (e.g. `refs TextAlignE`) returns High confidence instead of Low
- Alias annotation in output: references found via alias show `[via alias Y]` suffix (e.g. `AliasClient.scala:6 — val svc: US = ??? [via alias US]`)
